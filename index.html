You hit me with a cricket bat. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Saving the world with meals on wheels. You've swallowed a planet! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
                    <p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
